The FabISP is an in-system programmer which lets you program microcontrollers with only a USB cable and a 6-pin to 6-pin cable. I followed [this guide](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2012/labs/providence/tutorials/05.html) pretty closely to fabricate the board.

I ended up having to make three FabISPs, which gave me a big headache but also a ton of soldering practice. My mistakes were pretty silly: I flipped the orientation of the microcontroller on board 1, and board 2 had a missing copper trace which was too hard to fix. Board 3 worked perfectly, however!

Building the board is just three steps:
