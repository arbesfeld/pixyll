This week I wanted to measure water temperature, so I used a thermocouple:

{% include image.html url="/img/input_probe.jpg" description="" %}

{% include image.html url="/img/input_schematic.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_board.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_parts.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_stuffed.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_thermoprobe_wiring01.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_thermoprobe_wiring02.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/input_itworks.jpg" description="" %}

Unfortunately, my amplifier circuit was not strong enough, and the ATTiny could only detect
the temperature change to ~2 "points" with "analogRead". Next week, I hope to improve the amplifier
by using a part that I bought from Digikey.
