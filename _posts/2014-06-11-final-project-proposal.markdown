The tentative plan for my final project is to build a set of modular furniture pieces whose properties (light, sound, shape) can be controlled via a mobile device. The basic building blocks of the furniture are shelving units that are connected to one another via magnets. The magnetic link transmits power and data between the units. A central "brain" acts as the intermediary between the mobile device and furniture.

The simplest unit is a 2 x 2 x 2 foot shelving unit that has a fully-programmable LED light. To allow for more interesting structures, there are also 4/3 x 4/3 x 4/3 foot blocks and 2/3 x 2/3 x 4/3 blocks.

The modular nature of the system allows for endless possibilities in the individual units. I have some crazy ideas for units, but here are some of the more functional ones:

- A speaker unit which can play music
- A unit with drawers
- A taller unit that can fit hanging clothes
- A unit with an LCD screen

I used Autodesk 3ds Max for the renders. My most recent experience with 3ds Max is from 8th grade, so there was definitely a learning curve. However, I really appreciate the design iteration speed with 3ds Max. In the future, I plan to use 3ds Max for initial mockups, and then transfer my final design to SolidWorks for fabrication.
